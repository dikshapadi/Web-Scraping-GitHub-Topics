#Scraping Top Repos for Top Topics on GitHub
##Introduction to web scraping
- Web scraping is the process of extracting data from a specific web page. It involves making an HTTP request to a website’s server, downloading the page’s HTML and parsing it to extract the desired data.

##Problem Statement
- GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
- It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 
- GitHubTopics are labels that create subject-based connections between GitHub repositories and let you explore projects by type, technology, and more.

- Our motive is to gather all the top repos of the top topics on GitHub, ie perform web scraping for further data analysis. Web scraping can be done manually, but if the process involves a large number of web pages, it is more efficient to use an automated web scraping tool like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.

- Tools/Language used : Python, Beautiful Soup, Pandas
